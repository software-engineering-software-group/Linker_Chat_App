# Linker_Chat_App

1) Run Server. 
2) Run Client. > Enter Username > Enter Key 
3) Chat!

key = "LINKERKEY" if wrong key is typed, then all messages sent and recieved by the 'hacker' will be jumbled up. 

Note: server file MAY have a warning when run, (this was due to some missing folder called client-V2, please ignore this warning, and build and compile! it will still work as intended). This is beacue of the server application was included in the clients library for whitebox testing and the file has to be re-addded into the correct director for warning to disappear.

Platform: The application was originally designed in Netbeans and can run on any system with Netbeans installed. Additionally, the program can run on any platform as long as it supports GUI.
