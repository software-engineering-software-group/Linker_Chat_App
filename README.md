# Linker_Chat_App

1) Run Server. 
2) Run Client. > Enter Username > Enter Key 
3) Chat!

key = "LINKERKEY" if wrong key is typed, then all messages sent and recieved by the 'hacker' will be jumbled up. 

Note: server file may have a warning when run, (this was due to some missing folder called client-V2, please ignore this warning, and build and compile! it will still work as intended)
